# Customer Churn Analysis Using Power BI

## Introduction

This project analyzes customer churn data to understand the underlying reasons why customers discontinue their services. Customer churn—or customer attrition—is a critical performance metric, as losing existing customers negatively impacts revenue, and attracting new customers typically involves higher costs and resources. Consequently, reducing churn is a strategic priority for many organizations .

## Definition of Customer Churn

Customer churn is defined as the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. It can be quantified using the following formula:

Churn Rate = (Number of Customers Lost) /(Total Number of Customers)


Understanding and measuring churn can help companies:
- **Assess their competitive positioning:** Identifying areas where competitors might be outperforming.
- **Identify customer segments at risk:** Understanding which customer segments are more likely to leave.
- **Enhance service quality:** Pinpointing opportunities to improve customer satisfaction and retention.

## Key Findings

### Overall Churn Rate
- **General Rate:** The analysis revealed an overall churn rate of approximately 27% in the given dataset, indicating significant potential for improving retention strategies.

### Impact of Competition
- **Competitive Effects:** Analysis shows that around 45% of customer churn is associated with competitors’ offerings. This finding underscores the importance of maintaining a competitive edge and ensuring robust customer success initiatives .

### Geographic Analysis
- **California Case Study:** The churn rate in California was found to be abnormally high, exceeding 60%, suggesting that regional factors or competitive dynamics in this market may be driving customer attrition.

### Demographic Analysis
- **Age Factor:** There is a clear trend indicating that churn increases with age. For instance, customers over 85 years old exhibit a churn rate of 52%.

### Contract and Subscription Analysis
- **Group Contracts:** Customers subscribed to group contracts tend to have lower churn rates compared to those who are not part of such plans, demonstrating the cost effectiveness of these contracts.
- **Contract Duration:** A significant disparity exists between contract types; monthly contracts show a churn rate of 46.29%, whereas annual contracts have a substantially lower churn rate of 6.62% .

### Usage Patterns and Subscription Charges
- **Data Consumption:** Customers with an average monthly data consumption of 5 GB on an Unlimited Data Plan experience a higher churn rate compared to those with lower consumption levels.
- **International Calls:** Analysis of international call data indicates that 72% of customers do not have a dedicated international calling plan, highlighting a potential opportunity for targeted promotions .

### Customer Service Calls
- **Overall Trends:** The non-churned customer group averages approximately 0.37 calls to customer service, while the churned group averages about 2.20 calls. This disparity implies potential dissatisfaction that may contribute to higher churn.
- **California Specifics:** In California, despite a high churn rate of 63.24%, the average number of customer service calls is about 0.86 (totaling 44 calls), suggesting regional differences in customer communication behavior or service expectations.
